# [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
These are my solutions for the Advent of Code event, created by Eric Wastl!
My primary goal for these challenges is to get more practice using my programming language of choice during the duration period and motivate myself to practice writing code everyday! :blush:

## Description
From the [About Page](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about) on the website:
> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.
